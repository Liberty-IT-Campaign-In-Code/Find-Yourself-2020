# Find-Yourself-2020
Liberty Recruitment 2020 - a campaign in ascii.

We would love you to have a play with the code and see what you can do with it – submit it on GitHub before **Friday 23 October** and you could see it in our advertising campaign (and you might even win a Nespresso machine)!

# How to take part
To play with the code you will need to:

Download Processing – link here https://processing.org

Unzip the attached files and load into Processing.

Have a play with the code on 3 ad artworks.

Please apply your coding to the Find yourself valued/challenged or driving change and show us your code! Please leave the Liberty logo and the CTA at the bottom as they are.

Have fun and enjoy. We can’t wait to see your solutions!

And if you're having trouble adding your code to GitHub then contact the Communications Team :)
